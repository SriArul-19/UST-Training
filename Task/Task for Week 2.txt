Week 2 Concepts
---------------
1. inheritance
2. abstraction
3. encapsulation
4. collection

Inheritance

1. Create a class Animal with a method makeSound(). Then create a subclass Dog that overrides makeSound() to print "Bark".
2. Build a class Person with a method displayInfo(). Extend it with a class Student that adds a rollNumber and overrides displayInfo().
3. Write a base class Shape with a method area(). Create a subclass Circle that calculates area using radius.


abstraction

1. Create an abstract class Vehicle with an abstract method startEngine(). Implement it in a class Bike.
2. Make an abstract class Employee with a method calculateSalary(). Implement it in FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee.
3. Design an abstract class MediaPlayer with a method play(). Implement it in AudioPlayer and VideoPlayer.


Encapsulation

1. Create a class Account with private field balance. Add deposit() and getBalance() methods.
2. Build a class Book with private fields title and author. Use getters and setters to access them.
3. Create a class Temperature with a private field celsius. Add a method to convert it to Fahrenheit.


Collection

1. Use a List to store 5 integers. Write code to find the largest number.
2. Create a HashMap to store student names and their marks. Print all entries.
3. Use a Set to store unique city names. Try adding duplicate cities and print the set.
