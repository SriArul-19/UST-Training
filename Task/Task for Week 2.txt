Week 2 Concepts
---------------
1. inheritance
2. abstraction
3. encapsulation
4. collection

Inheritance

1. Create a class Device with method start(). Subclass Phone and Laptop override start() with different messages.
2. Make a class Animal with method sound(). Subclass Cow and Lion override sound() to print their own sounds.
3. Create a class Game with method play(). Subclass Football and Chess override play() with their own rules.


Abstraction

1. Create an abstract class Transport with abstract method fuelType(). Subclass Car and Train implement it with different fuel types.
2. Abstract class Document with method print(). Subclass PDF and WordDoc implement print() differently.
3. Abstract class Appliance with method operate(). Subclass Fan and WashingMachine show different operations.


Encapsulation

1. Class Mobile with private field batteryLevel. Add method to charge and check battery.
2. Class User with private fields username and password. Add methods to update and validate password.
3. Class Movie with private field rating. Add method to set rating only between 1 and 5.


Collection

1. Use ArrayList<String> to store names of fruits. Add, remove, and display them.
2. Use HashMap<String, String> to store country and capital. Print all entries.
3. Use LinkedList<String> to simulate a playlist. Add songs and play them in order.
